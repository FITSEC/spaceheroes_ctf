## References

We used the following resources to create challenges. 

1. The [Angr CTF](https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf) served as motivation for the Launch Code, Times Up, and SATisfied constraint challenges. Further, our solutions are modeled after the *scaffolding files* from the [Angr CTF](https://github.com/jakespringer/angr_ctf). 

2. Shai Hulud is motivated by a similar challenge that [Carl](https://github.com/carlinux727) encountered while competing in the [US Cyber Quest](https://uscc.cyberquests.org). Used a Snake implemntation by [h33p](https://github.com/h33p/Basic-Snake) as backbone for the challenge.

3. Blachole ROP is motivated by the [ROP Puzzle](https://ctftime.org/writeup/31894) challenge that [TJ](https://github.com/tj-oconnor) encountered while competing in [X-MAS CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1525). 

4. FRK War is motivated by the [Fraud Detector](https://ctftime.org/writeup/32251) challenge [TJ](https://github.com/tj-oconnor) encountered while competing in [24h@CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1563).

5. Buzz's Secret Watch was inspired by the [ex-piltration](https://ctftime.org/task/18752) challenge we failed to solve in [Insomni'hack teaser 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1505). In homage to their CTF challenge, we used the three lines of text_to_bits() function from their challenge in our challenge. 

6. Space Flag uses an image from [NASA](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2022/009/01FTVACXX6AYTPDYN8Y3CH3WPA?keyword=Exoplanets&news=true) as the background. In accordance with their [content use policy](https://hubblesite.org/copyright), we acknowledge this image is the work of NASA and STScI. 

7. R2D2 uses [an image](https://sites.psu.edu/calvinpassion/wp-content/uploads/sites/39979/2016/03/droid1.jpg) from a Penn State University [Blog Post](https://sites.psu.edu/calvinpassion/2016/03/31/r2d2-and-chewbacca-galactic-men-of-mystery/) about Star Wars. The image appears in wide circulation in the public domain and we are unsure of its original origin but assumed to be a partial screenshot from the Star Wars movie franchise.

8. [TJ](https://github.com/tj-oconnor) builds his docker containers off the template published by the [Order of the Overflow](https://github.com/o-o-overflow) for their [DEFCON 2019 Speed Run Challenges](https://github.com/o-o-overflow/dc2019q-speedrun-001). 


9. The watch face from Buzz's secret watch was modified from a [watch face image](https://www.facer.io/watchface/L3nmvMJjYE?watchModel=moto360sport) created for Facer.io

10. A [blog post on cryptohack](https://blog.cryptohack.org/twitter-secrets) served as motivation for  [Isaiah's](https://github.com/IsaiahST2020) Information Paradox problem.

11. [Carl](https://github.com/carlinux727) took [Max Kamper's Heap Exploitation Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-heap-exploitation-part-1/) course and used Max's glibc libraries to build the Use the Force challenge.
