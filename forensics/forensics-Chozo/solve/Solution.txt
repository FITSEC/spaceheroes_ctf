1. Identifying the file
- hexdump(or any other tool that dumps hex) the file and inspect the file header
Since the Header yields no good information since it has been scrambled the give aways are the
IDAT and IEND strings scattered throughout the hex dumps
  PNGs use IDAT to hold the image data and IEND to signify the end of the data stream
Thus this is a PNG file

2. Why wont it open?
- While the contents refer to a PNG two major things are prevent it from opening
  - The header
  - The Extension

The Header
The first 16 bytes of the Header are:
[50 47 89 0A 4E 0D 0A 1A-0D 48 44 00 52 00 00 49]
[1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16]
By using the PNG Signature as reference
The first 8 bytes should be:
[89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A]
[1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ]
The last 8 bytes is notably the IHDR header which should be:
[00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52]
[9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16]

The Extension
Simply renaming the extension to .png will work

3. Open the image and obtain the flag
