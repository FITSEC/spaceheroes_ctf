Solution:
To send a secret message within messages the rebel alliance
structured each message they sent as follows
[  1  ][  2  ][  3   ]
[XX:XX]Message[Sender]
[1] Location where to splice the current message, XX being indices
[2] Diversion message
[3] Sender, which is just Anon followed by a letter and number

There are 5 Diversion Messages mixed in with some junk packets
2 [ICMP] related messages, each packet holds 1 char of the entire message.
    - The first is scattered through the file in 7 sections, sorting by sender
    and protocol helps
    -The Second the Diversion message is reversed, found towards the end of the pcap
2 [TCP] related Messages
  -One of the messages requires both the sender and receiver of the packets as
   they both only have half of the messages
   -Second the receiver mimics and sends every packet they received, filtering either
   the sender or receiver makes this easier
1 [UDP] related messages
  - The message is hidden within the destination port

With all the messages collected, splicing them on the indices provides yields
