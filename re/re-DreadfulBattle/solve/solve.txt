In order to succesfully beat Raven Beak, Samus must flawlessy execute her combo.
[Charge, Blast, Dodge, Rocket, Blast, Charge, Fire!] <-- Input to defeat Raven
Beak, in this exact order

Although defeating Raven doesn't reward you the flag, the flag is actually hidden throughout
the battle function through print statements, But it relies on the correct sequence of
user input to be revealed properly. The easy way to go about this is to patch the binary by removing the
ptrace check, and dynamically analyzing the print statements. Hard way is to statically trace Every
character that is being printed. note that the begining of the flag (shctf{) is actually hidden before the
battle function in an unused variable.
